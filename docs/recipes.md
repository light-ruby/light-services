# Recipes

This section contains practical recipes for common patterns when using Operandi.

- [CRUD](crud.md) - Implementing top-level services for CRUD operations
- [Service Rendering](service-rendering.md) - Easy way to render service results and errors
- [Pundit Authorization](pundit-authorization.md) - Integrating Pundit authorization with Operandi

## Getting Started

These recipes build upon each other. We recommend starting with CRUD services, then adding service rendering for cleaner controllers, and finally integrating Pundit for authorization.
